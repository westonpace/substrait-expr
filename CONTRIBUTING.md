# Governance Model

This project is currently following the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) governance
model (with Weston Pace as BDFL) simply because there are no other committers at the moment.  Should any Substrait
committers take an interest in the project and contribute then I will happily donate the project to the Substrait
orgnaization.

Therefore, this project has a [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1.
